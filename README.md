Next Book is an app for book lovers to help them find their next books. 
It provides lists of the latest best-sellers and has a search engine based on author 
name or book title. Recommendations are provided based on books that users 
have read and enjoyed. A personal to-read list helps users keep track of books
that they would like to read in the future.
